# AI Story Intelligence

## Overview

AI Story Intelligence transforms story-linter from a rule-based validator into an intelligent writing partner.

**Postcondition**: Distinct character voices

### UC3: Emotional Arc Analysis
**Actor**: Author  
**Precondition**: Complete manuscript  
**Flow**:
1. Author requests emotional arc analysis
2. AI maps emotional journey by chapter
3. AI identifies flat or jarring sections
4. AI suggests intensification points
5. Author adjusts based on insights

**Postcondition**: Optimized emotional journey

### UC4: Reader Confusion Prediction
**Actor**: Author  
**Precondition**: Complex plot with reveals  
**Flow**:

## Example Interactions

### Plot Hole Detection
```
ü§ñ AI Alert: Potential Plot Hole Detected

In Chapter 12, Sarah uses her telekinetic powers to escape.
However, these powers were never established earlier.

üìä Reader Confusion Risk: 87%

Suggestions:
1. Add a scene in Chapter 3 where Sarah discovers her powers
2. Include hints in Chapters 5-7 about strange occurrences
3. Have another character mention family history in Chapter 8

### Character Voice Analysis
```
üé≠ Character Voice Inconsistency

Marcus (usually formal) sounds casual in this dialogue:
"Yeah, totally gonna check that out later, dude."

Marcus's established voice patterns:
- Formal vocabulary (87% of dialogue)
- Complete sentences (94% of dialogue)  
- Rarely uses slang (2% of dialogue)

Suggested revision:
"I shall certainly investigate that matter at a later time."

### Pacing Optimization
```
üìà Pacing Analysis Complete

Current pacing profile:
Chapters 1-3: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà High tension
Chapters 4-8: ‚ñà‚ñà       Low tension  ‚ö†Ô∏è 
Chapters 9-10: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà High tension

Issue: 5 consecutive low-tension chapters may lose readers

Suggestions:
- Add subplot climax in Chapter 6
- Move character revelation from Ch 11 to Ch 7
- Introduce time pressure in Chapter 5
