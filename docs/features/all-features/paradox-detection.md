# Paradox Detection

## Overview

Paradox Detection identifies and reports temporal paradoxes, logical contradictions, and causality violations within narratives. This feature is essential for stories involving time travel, parallel universes, or complex chronologies, ensuring that temporal logic remains consistent even when dealing with non-linear narratives.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Classic Paradox Identification
- **Grandfather Paradox**: Actions that would prevent the actor's existence
- **Bootstrap Paradox**: Information or objects with no origin point
- **Predestination Paradox**: Circular causality loops
- **Observer Paradox**: Changes caused by observation of future events

### 2. Causality Violation Detection
- Identifies broken cause-and-effect chains
- Detects events that occur before their causes
- Finds actions that negate their own prerequisites
- Validates temporal consistency of motivations

### 3. Timeline Contradiction Analysis
- Detects mutually exclusive events in the same timeline
- Identifies impossible overlaps in character locations/states
- Finds contradictory outcomes from the same cause
- Validates timeline branching logic

### 4. Information Paradox Tracking
- Knowledge that exists before its discovery
- Self-fulfilling prophecies and their consistency
- Information loops with no external source
- Future knowledge affecting past decisions

## Use Cases

### Time Travel Fiction
- Validates consistency of time travel rules
- Ensures paradoxes are intentional and addressed
- Tracks butterfly effects and their consequences
- Monitors timeline stability after changes

### Alternate History
- Validates divergence points and their effects
- Ensures historical changes propagate correctly
- Detects anachronistic cascade effects
- Monitors paradoxes in changed timelines

### Prophetic/Precognitive Stories
- Tracks prophecy fulfillment and consistency
- Validates that visions align with actual events
- Detects self-defeating prophecies
- Ensures prophetic knowledge is used consistently

### Mystery/Thriller Plots
- Prevents impossible alibis
- Validates locked room mysteries
- Ensures fair play with temporal clues
- Detects retrospective plot holes

## Technical Implementation

### Data Model
```typescript
interface Paradox {
  id: string;
  type: ParadoxType;
  severity: 'minor' | 'major' | 'critical';
  elements: ParadoxElement[];
  location: NarrativePosition[];
  description: string;
  possibleResolutions?: string[];
}

enum ParadoxType {
  GRANDFATHER = 'grandfather',
  BOOTSTRAP = 'bootstrap',
  PREDESTINATION = 'predestination',
  CAUSALITY_LOOP = 'causality_loop',
  TIMELINE_CONTRADICTION = 'timeline_contradiction',
  INFORMATION_LOOP = 'information_loop',
  ONTOLOGICAL = 'ontological'
}

interface CausalChain {
  events: CausalEvent[];
  validated: boolean;
  breaks: CausalityBreak[];
}

interface TemporalRule {
  id: string;
  rule: string;
  scope: 'global' | 'timeline' | 'character';
  violations: RuleViolation[];
}
```

### Detection Algorithms

#### Causality Graph Analysis
1. Build directed graph of cause-effect relationships
2. Detect cycles in the causality graph
3. Identify isolated causal loops
4. Validate all effects have valid causes

#### Timeline Consistency Checking
1. Compare events across timeline branches
2. Detect mutual exclusions
3. Validate character state continuity
4. Check for impossible simultaneity

#### Information Flow Validation
1. Trace information origin points
2. Detect circular information dependencies
3. Validate knowledge timeline consistency
4. Identify bootstrap information

## Dependencies

### Required Components
- **Multi-Timeline Analysis**: For cross-timeline paradoxes
- **Causal Chain Analysis**: For causality validation
- **Information Revelation Tracking**: For information paradoxes
- **Story vs Narrative Time Tracking**: For temporal consistency

### Integration Points
- Provides data for Timeline Visualization
- Works with Interactive Mode for paradox resolution
- Feeds into Temporal Validation Framework
- Integrates with genre-specific validators

## Output Formats

### Paradox Report
```json
{
  "paradoxes": [
    {
      "type": "bootstrap",
      "severity": "major",
      "description": "Watch has no origin - given by future self to past self",
      "locations": ["Chapter 5, Page 123", "Chapter 12, Page 298"],
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "object",
          "name": "golden watch",
          "issue": "circular existence"
        }
      ],
      "suggestedResolutions": [
        "Add scene showing watch's original acquisition",
        "Acknowledge paradox as intentional plot element",
        "Introduce timeline where watch is created"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "causalityBreaks": [
    {
      "cause": "Character prevents parents from meeting",
      "effect": "Character continues to exist",
      "issue": "Grandfather paradox",
      "severity": "critical"
    }
  ],
  "timelineHealth": {
    "score": 72,

    "minor_issues": 5
  }
}

## Configuration

```yaml
paradox-detection:
  enabled: true
  strictness: medium  # low, medium, high
  paradox-types:
    detect-grandfather: true
    detect-bootstrap: true
    detect-predestination: true
    detect-information-loops: true
  time-travel-rules:
    mode: "branching"  # branching, overwrite, parallel
    allow-paradoxes: false
    paradox-resolution: "auto-branch"
  genre-specific:
    hard-sci-fi: true  # Stricter paradox rules
    fantasy: false     # More lenient with paradoxes
  reporting:
    include-resolutions: true
    severity-threshold: "minor"
```

## Validation Examples

### Bootstrap Paradox
```
Chapter 3: John receives poem from future self
Chapter 15: John travels back to give poem to past self
Issue: Poem has no original author
```

### Causality Violation
```
Chapter 1: Building destroyed in earthquake
Chapter 8: Character prevents earthquake  
Chapter 9: Character still traumatized by building collapse
Issue: Effect persists without cause
```

## Performance Considerations

- Incremental paradox checking on changes
- Efficient graph algorithms for cycle detection
- Caching of validated causal chains
- Parallel timeline analysis
- Early termination for critical paradoxes

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning for paradox pattern recognition
- Automated paradox resolution suggestions
- Quantum narrative state modeling
- Genre-aware paradox tolerance
- Integration with physics simulation
