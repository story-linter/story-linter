# Temporal Validation

## Overview

Temporal Validation is a comprehensive feature that ensures all time-related elements in a narrative remain consistent and logical. It validates dates, durations, character ages, seasonal references, and the passage of time across the entire story, serving as the foundational temporal consistency checker.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Date and Time Consistency
- Validates specific dates and times mentioned in narrative
- Ensures chronological consistency across chapters
- Detects impossible date combinations
- Validates day-of-week accuracy for specific dates

### 2. Duration Validation
- Tracks elapsed time between events
- Validates realistic durations for activities
- Ensures travel times match distances
- Monitors pregnancy and growth durations

### 3. Age Progression Tracking
- Maintains accurate character ages throughout story
- Validates age-appropriate behaviors and capabilities
- Tracks relative ages between characters
- Detects impossible age scenarios

### 4. Environmental Time Markers
- Validates seasonal descriptions against timeline
- Ensures weather patterns match seasons
- Tracks lunar phases and astronomical events
- Monitors cultural/holiday timing accuracy

## Use Cases

### Contemporary Fiction
- Ensures weekdays match calendar dates
- Validates business hours and schedules
- Tracks realistic travel times
- Monitors technology availability by year

### Historical Fiction
- Validates historical event dates
- Ensures period-appropriate technology
- Tracks accurate historical figure ages
- Monitors anachronistic references

### Fantasy/Sci-Fi
- Maintains consistent alternate calendars
- Tracks non-standard time systems
- Validates magical aging effects
- Monitors time dilation consequences

### Series and Sequels
- Maintains continuity across books
- Tracks long-term character aging
- Validates technology progression
- Ensures consistent world timeline

## Technical Implementation

### Data Model
```typescript
interface TemporalElement {
  id: string;
  type: 'date' | 'duration' | 'age' | 'season' | 'time';
  value: TemporalValue;
  position: NarrativePosition;
  confidence: number;
  source: 'explicit' | 'inferred';
}

interface TemporalConstraint {
  type: ConstraintType;
  elements: string[];  // Element IDs
  rule: string;
  validation: ValidationResult;
}

interface CharacterAge {
  characterId: string;
  timeline: AgePoint[];
  validation: AgeValidation;
}

interface AgePoint {
  position: NarrativePosition;
  age: number;
  source: 'stated' | 'calculated' | 'inferred';
  confidence: number;
}

interface SeasonalMarker {
  position: NarrativePosition;
  season: 'spring' | 'summer' | 'fall' | 'winter';
  hemisphere: 'northern' | 'southern';
  indicators: string[];  // "snow", "blooming flowers", etc.
}
```

### Validation Rules

#### Date Validation
- Calendar accuracy (leap years, days in month)
- Day-of-week correspondence
- Historical date accuracy
- Future date plausibility

#### Duration Rules
- Minimum realistic durations
- Maximum plausible durations
- Activity-specific constraints
- Travel time calculations

#### Age Consistency
- Linear age progression
- Relative age maintenance
- Biological possibility
- Mental/physical capability matching

## Dependencies

### Required Components
- **Natural Language Processing**: For temporal expression extraction
- **Schema Engine**: For learning story-specific temporal patterns
- **Character Tracking**: For age progression
- **Event Detection**: For temporal anchor points

### Integration Points
- Provides foundation for advanced temporal features
- Feeds into Timeline Visualization
- Works with Multi-Timeline Analysis
- Essential for Paradox Detection

## Configuration

```yaml
temporal-validation:
  enabled: true
  strictness: medium
  date-validation:
    format: "auto-detect"  # or specific format
    calendar: "gregorian"
    validate-weekdays: true
    historical-accuracy: true
  age-tracking:
    track-all-characters: true
    biological-limits: true
    relative-age-validation: true
  duration-checking:
    travel-time-validation: true
    activity-duration: true
    human-limits: true
  seasonal-validation:
    hemisphere: "northern"
    climate-zone: "temperate"
    validate-weather: true
  custom-rules:
    - "Pregnancies last 9 months ± 1 month"
    - "School years run September to June"
```

## Validation Examples

### Valid Temporal Flow
```
Chapter 1: "Monday, March 1, 2021" ✓
Chapter 2: "Three days later" = March 4, 2021 (Thursday) ✓
Chapter 3: "The following Monday" = March 8, 2021 ✓
```

### Age Inconsistency
```
Chapter 1: Sarah is 25 years old
Chapter 10: "Two years later"
Chapter 11: Sarah celebrates her 26th birthday ✗
(Should be 27)
```

### Duration Issue
```
9:00 AM: Character leaves London
10:30 AM: Character arrives in Edinburgh ✗
(Minimum travel time ~4.5 hours)
```

## Performance Considerations

- Incremental validation on changes
- Cached temporal calculations
- Lazy age progression computation
- Efficient date arithmetic
- Smart validation scheduling

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-calendar support (lunar, fictional)
- Relativistic time dilation calculations
- Cultural event validation
- Biological development tracking
- Integration with real-world event databases
