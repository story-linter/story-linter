# Multi-Timeline Analysis

## Overview

Multi-Timeline Analysis enables Story Linter to track and validate narratives that contain multiple concurrent or intersecting timelines. This feature handles complex narrative structures including parallel universes, alternate realities, time travel, and multi-perspective storytelling.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Timeline Detection and Classification
- Automatically identifies distinct timelines within a narrative
- Classifies timeline types (primary, alternate, dream, memory, future vision)
- Detects timeline branching points and convergence events
- Tracks timeline hierarchies (nested timelines, meta-timelines)

### 2. Cross-Timeline Validation
- Ensures consistency of shared events across timelines
- Validates character existence and age across different timelines
- Checks for logical consistency in timeline interactions
- Detects and reports timeline contamination or bleed-through

### 3. Timeline Relationship Mapping
- Maps causal relationships between timelines
- Identifies timeline dependencies and prerequisites
- Tracks timeline synchronization points
- Validates timeline merge and split operations

### 4. Parallel Event Tracking
- Monitors simultaneous events across timelines
- Validates temporal synchronization between timelines
- Detects temporal drift between supposedly parallel timelines
- Ensures consistent passage of time across all active timelines

## Use Cases

### Science Fiction Time Travel
- Track multiple timeline branches created by time travel
- Validate consistency of time travel rules across timelines
- Detect and report temporal paradoxes between timelines
- Monitor butterfly effects across timeline variations

### Multi-Perspective Narratives
- Ensure events align when shown from different viewpoints
- Validate that shared moments remain consistent
- Track information availability in each perspective
- Synchronize character movements across perspectives

### Alternate Reality Stories
- Manage multiple parallel universes
- Track divergence points between realities
- Validate consistency within each reality
- Monitor cross-reality interactions and rules

### Dream/Vision Sequences
- Distinguish dream timelines from reality
- Track prophetic visions and their fulfillment
- Validate dream logic vs reality logic
- Ensure clear timeline type identification

## Technical Implementation

### Data Model
```typescript
interface Timeline {
  id: string;
  type: 'primary' | 'alternate' | 'dream' | 'memory' | 'vision' | 'parallel';
  parent?: string;  // For nested timelines
  branchPoint?: TemporalEvent;
  mergePoint?: TemporalEvent;
  timelineRules: TimelineRules;
  events: TemporalEvent[];
}

interface TimelineRelationship {
  source: string;
  target: string;
  type: 'branch' | 'merge' | 'parallel' | 'nested' | 'influence';
  syncPoints: SynchronizationPoint[];
}

interface CrossTimelineValidation {
  sharedEvents: SharedEvent[];
  characterConsistency: CharacterState[];
  temporalAlignment: AlignmentCheck[];
}
```

### Detection Algorithm
1. Identify timeline markers in text (reality shifts, time travel, "meanwhile")
2. Cluster events by timeline continuity
3. Detect timeline boundaries and transitions
4. Build timeline relationship graph
5. Validate cross-timeline consistency

## Dependencies

### Required Components
- **Story vs Narrative Time Tracking**: For individual timeline analysis
- **Schema Extraction Engine**: To identify timeline patterns
- **Event Detection**: To identify and cluster events
- **Natural Language Processing**: For timeline marker detection

### Integration Points
- Feeds into Paradox Detection for cross-timeline paradoxes
- Provides data for Timeline Visualization
- Works with Causal Chain Analysis for inter-timeline causality

## Output Formats

### Timeline Report
```json
{
  "timelines": [
    {
      "id": "primary",
      "type": "primary",
      "eventCount": 234,
      "span": "1990-2010"
    },
    {
      "id": "alternate-1",
      "type": "alternate",
      "branchPoint": "Chapter 5 - Time machine activation",
      "divergence": "high",
      "eventCount": 89
    }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "type": "branch",
      "source": "primary",
      "target": "alternate-1",
      "point": "Chapter 5, Page 123"
    }
  ],
  "validationIssues": [
    {
      "type": "inconsistent-shared-event",
      "timelines": ["primary", "alternate-1"],
      "event": "City founding date",
      "discrepancy": "Different years in each timeline"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Visual Timeline Map
- Network graph showing timeline relationships
- Synchronized timeline tracks for comparison
- Highlighted divergence and convergence points
- Color-coded timeline types

## Configuration

```yaml
multi-timeline-analysis:
  enabled: true
  max-concurrent-timelines: 10
  timeline-markers:
    - "in another reality"
    - "meanwhile, in universe"
    - "back in the primary timeline"
    - "in the alternate future"
  validation:
    cross-timeline-consistency: true
    shared-event-validation: true
    character-continuity: true
    temporal-alignment: strict
  timeline-types:
    detect-alternate-realities: true
    detect-dream-sequences: true
    detect-memory-timelines: true
    detect-parallel-narratives: true
```

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading of timeline data
- Incremental timeline construction
- Parallel validation of independent timelines
- Efficient timeline diff algorithms
- Cached timeline relationships

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning for timeline type classification
- Automated timeline merge conflict resolution
- Quantum narrative state tracking
- Visual timeline editing interface
- Timeline complexity metrics
