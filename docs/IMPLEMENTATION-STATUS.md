# Story Linter Implementation Status

## Executive Summary

Story Linter MVP is **feature-complete** with core validation functionality working. However, several components need refactoring to meet our coding standards (SOLID principles, dependency injection, test doubles).

## Feature-by-Feature Analysis

### 1. Core Package - File Processing

**Standards Compliance: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL**

#### ‚úÖ What's Good:
- `FileReader` (refactored version) uses proper dependency injection
- Tests use test doubles, not spies
- Streaming support for large files
- Metadata extraction framework

#### ‚ùå Issues:
- `FileDiscovery` lacks dependency injection (uses glob/fs directly)
- `FileDiscovery` has no tests
- Original `FileReader` violates SRP with multiple responsibilities

#### üîß Needs:
- Refactor `FileDiscovery` to use injected dependencies
- Add comprehensive tests for `FileDiscovery`
- Remove or archive original `FileReader`

### 2. Core Package - Validation Framework

**Standards Compliance: ‚ùå POOR**

#### ‚úÖ What's Good:
- Plugin architecture works
- Event system for progress tracking
- Base validator abstract class is clean

#### ‚ùå Issues:
- **Major SRP Violation**: `ValidationFramework` handles too many responsibilities
- **No DI**: Creates own instances of FileReader, FileDiscovery, ConfigLoader
- **No Tests**: Missing unit tests entirely
- Too many responsibilities in one class

#### üîß Needs:
- Extract responsibilities into separate classes
- Inject all dependencies
- Add comprehensive test suite
- Consider splitting into ValidationOrchestrator, PluginManager, etc.

### 3. Core Package - Configuration System

**Standards Compliance: ‚ùå POOR**

#### ‚úÖ What's Good:
- Basic YAML loading works
- Caching implemented
- Single responsibility (mostly)

#### ‚ùå Issues:
- **No DI**: Directly uses fs/promises
- **No Tests**: Missing unit tests
- Limited functionality (no extends, no env vars)

#### üîß Needs:
- Add FileSystem port and inject it
- Create comprehensive tests
- Consider adding ConfigValidator class

### 4. Character Consistency Validator

**Standards Compliance: ‚úÖ GOOD**

#### ‚úÖ What's Good:
- Proper extension of BaseValidator
- Uses injected context appropriately
- Comprehensive test suite with test doubles
- Extensible design for story-specific features

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues:
- Character extraction logic is complex (but acceptable)
- Could benefit from extracting regex patterns to constants

### 5. Link Graph Validator  

**Standards Compliance: ‚úÖ EXCELLENT**

#### ‚úÖ What's Good:
- Clean single responsibility
- Proper use of BaseValidator
- Good test coverage with test doubles
- Simple, focused implementation
- Follows KISS principle

### 6. CLI Implementation

**Standards Compliance: ‚úÖ EXCELLENT**

#### ‚úÖ What's Good:
- **Properly Refactored**: Split into focused classes
  - CLI: Command setup only
  - CommandHandler: Command execution
  - ValidationRunner: Orchestration
  - OutputFormatters: Result formatting
  - ColorPort: Abstraction over chalk
- All dependencies injected
- Comprehensive test doubles
- No spies used in tests
- Clean separation of concerns

## Overall Assessment

### Completed & Up to Standards ‚úÖ
1. CLI Package (after refactoring)
2. Link Graph Validator
3. Character Consistency Validator
4. Base abstractions (BaseValidator, ports)

### Needs Work to Meet Standards ‚ùå
1. ValidationFramework - Major refactoring needed
2. ConfigLoader - Add DI and tests
3. FileDiscovery - Add DI and tests

### Architecture Strengths
- Plugin system works well
- Streaming approach is solid
- Event system enables progress tracking
- Base abstractions are clean

### Architecture Weaknesses
- Core framework components violate SOLID
- Missing dependency injection in key areas
- Insufficient test coverage for core components

## Refactoring Plan Summary

We will NOT ship with SOLID violations. Here's our 5-day plan:

### Phase 1: Core Architecture (Days 1-2)
- Refactor ValidationFramework using TDD
- Fix ConfigLoader with DI
- Fix FileDiscovery with DI

### Phase 2: Performance (Day 3)
- Implement Incremental Validation (critical for UX)
- Add simple parallel file processing

### Phase 3: Testing (Day 4)
- Create GitScrolls test subset
- Write integration tests
- Performance benchmarks

### Phase 4: Ship It! (Day 5)
- Polish documentation
- Prepare npm packages
- Final validation

## Why This Order?

1. **ValidationFramework first** - Biggest architectural debt
2. **Performance second** - Critical for developer experience
3. **Testing third** - Validates our refactoring
4. **Documentation last** - Once everything is stable

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All components follow SOLID principles
- [ ] 100% test coverage for core components
- [ ] <5s validation for 100 files (with cache)
- [ ] GitScrolls validates successfully
- [ ] Clean npm publish

## Test Coverage Summary

| Component | Unit Tests | Test Doubles | DI Used | SOLID |
|-----------|------------|--------------|---------|--------|
| CLI | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Character Validator | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Link Validator | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| FileReader (refactored) | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| ValidationFramework | ‚ùå | N/A | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| ConfigLoader | ‚ùå | N/A | ‚ùå | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| FileDiscovery | ‚ùå | N/A | ‚ùå | ‚ö†Ô∏è |

## Questions/Decisions Needed

1. **Should we refactor ValidationFramework now or after MVP?**
   - It works but violates our principles significantly

2. **IoC Container?**
   - Manual DI is getting verbose, consider InversifyJS or similar?

3. **Performance Requirements**
   - Not implemented yet - is this MVP critical?

4. **Additional File Formats**
   - Currently only Markdown - add .txt, .json support?

5. **Missing CLI Commands**
   - Only validate implemented - which others are MVP?
